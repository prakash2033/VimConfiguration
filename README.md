# VimConfiguration
This repo contains my Vim Configuration

## Pre-requisite
- Off-course `VIM` should be installed.
- I use `Rxvt-Unicode`; `urxvt` Terminal. 
- The script should work with any terminal though.

## How to install
For now you have to copy all the files manually to your `$HOME` directory, too lazy to type a copy script :P
